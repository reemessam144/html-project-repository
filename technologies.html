	<h3>Technologies</h3>
A 2011 McKinsey Global Institute report characterizes the main components and ecosystem of big data as follows:[44]

    Techniques for analyzing data, such as A/B testing, machine learning, and natural language processing
    Big data technologies, like business intelligence, cloud computing, and databases
    Visualization, such as charts, graphs, and other displays of the data

Multidimensional big data can also be represented as OLAP data cubes or, mathematically, tensors. Array database systems have set out to provide storage and high-level query support on this data type. Additional technologies being applied to big data include efficient tensor-based computation,[45] such as multilinear subspace learning,[46] massively parallel-processing (MPP) databases, search-based applications, data mining,[47] distributed file systems, distributed cache (e.g., burst buffer and Memcached), distributed databases, cloud and HPC-based infrastructure (applications, storage and computing resources),[48] and the Internet.[citation needed] Although, many approaches and technologies have been developed, it still remains difficult to carry out machine learning with big data.[49]

Some MPP relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data. Implicit is the ability to load, monitor, back up, and optimize the use of the large data tables in the RDBMS.[50][promotional source?]

DARPA's Topological Data Analysis program seeks the fundamental structure of massive data sets and in 2008 the technology went public with the launch of a company called "Ayasdi".[51][third-party source needed]
